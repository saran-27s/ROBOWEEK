BlockChain application for ethereum fraud detection.

**CryptoTrace**

CryptoTrace is a cryptocurrency transaction analysis tool designed to analyze and visualize cryptocurrency transactions, particularly focusing on Ethereum. The tool includes features for transaction analysis, visualization, PDF report generation, and suspicious activity detection.

**Features**

Transaction Analysis: Analyze transactions for suspicious patterns.
Visualization: Generate spider maps and charts to visualize transaction flows.
PDF Report Generation: Generate detailed reports with visualizations and analyses.
Suspicious Activity Detection: Identify and flag suspicious transactions.

**Installation**
Clone the repository: bash git clone https://github.com/username/CryptoTrace.git cd CryptoTrace

Install dependencies: bash pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up the database: bash python manage.py migrate

Run the server: bash python manage.py runserver

**Usage**
Home Page: Navigate to the home page to input wallet addresses and view analysis results.

Transaction Analysis: Input a wallet address and date range to fetch and analyze transactions.

Visualization: View spider maps and charts to understand transaction flows and connections.

PDF Report: Generate a detailed PDF report of the analysis.

**Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! Please submit a pull request or open an issue for any improvements or bug fixes. Technologies Used Frontend HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core web technologies for structuring, styling, and scripting the user interface. Django Templates: Used for rendering HTML pages dynamically. JavaScript Libraries: Utilized for data visualization (e.g., PyVis for interactive graphs). Backend Django: High-level Python web framework for building the backend. Python: Programming language used for backend development and data processing. PyVis: Python library for creating interactive network visualizations. NetworkX: Python package for creating and analyzing complex networks. Data Fetching Using Etherscan API API Integration:

Integrated Etherscan API by constructing requests to fetch transaction data. Used the requests library in Python to handle API calls. Fetching Transactions:

Constructed API endpoints to fetch transaction lists for a given wallet address. Handled pagination and errors to ensure complete and accurate data retrieval. Example endpoint: https://api.etherscan.io/api?module=account&action=txlist&address=wallet_address&startblock=0&endblock=99999999&sort=asc&apikey=ETHERSCAN_API_KEY Data Processing:

Parsed the JSON response from the API. Converted transaction values from Wei to ETH. Filtered transactions by date range if specified. Database Management Database Models:

Defined Django models to represent transactions and other related data. Used Django ORM for database interactions, ensuring clean and efficient queries. Efficient Data Storage:

Stored transaction data in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL). Indexed key fields (e.g., wallet addresses, transaction hashes) to optimize query performance. Handling Large Datasets:

Implemented batch processing to handle large volumes of transaction data. Used efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize memory usage and processing time. Data Security:

Encrypted sensitive data stored in the database. Implemented authentication and authorization to restrict access to sensitive information. Used HTTPS for secure data transmission. Performance Optimization:

Optimized database queries by using indexing and caching. Conducted performance testing and made necessary adjustments to ensure the system could handle large datasets efficiently.
